# RadioCalico Refactoring Plan: Complete Overview

## Executive Summary

RadioCalico is currently implemented as a monolithic application with a 1,080-line HTML file containing embedded CSS and JavaScript, and a basic Node.js backend. This comprehensive refactoring plan transforms the application into a modern, scalable, maintainable, and production-ready system following industry best practices.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified
- **Monolithic Frontend**: Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript (1,080+ lines)
- **Basic Backend**: Single server.js handling all concerns
- **No Build Process**: Manual file management, no optimization
- **No Testing**: Zero automated tests or quality assurance
- **No Performance Optimization**: No caching, minification, or monitoring
- **No Documentation**: Limited inline comments, no formal documentation

### Technical Debt
- Hard-coded configurations scattered throughout code
- No separation of concerns
- Direct DOM manipulation mixed with business logic
- No error handling strategy
- Inline styles preventing consistent theming
- No offline functionality or progressive enhancement
