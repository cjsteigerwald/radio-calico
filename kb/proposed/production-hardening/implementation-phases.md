   - Mitigation: Multiple backups, staged migration, validation scripts

2. **Extended Downtime**
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment, maintenance windows, rollback plan

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, gradual rollout, monitoring

### Rollback Procedures

#### Database Rollback
```bash
# Stop application
pm2 stop all

# Restore PostgreSQL backup
pg_restore -h localhost -U radiocalico -d radiocalico_backup backup.dump

# Switch application to backup database
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://radiocalico@localhost/radiocalico_backup

# Restart application
pm2 start all
```

#### nginx Rollback
```bash
# Restore previous configuration
cp /backup/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

nginx -t

# Reload nginx
systemctl reload nginx
```
