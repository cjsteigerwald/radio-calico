# Production Hardening Plan for RadioCalico

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to harden RadioCalico for production deployment by migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL for the database backend and implementing nginx as a reverse proxy and static file server. This transition will provide enterprise-grade scalability, security, and performance.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Database Migration**: Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for improved concurrency and scalability
2. **Web Server Optimization**: Implement nginx for static file serving and reverse proxy capabilities
3. **Security Hardening**: Add multiple layers of security for production deployment
4. **Performance Enhancement**: Optimize for high-traffic production environments
5. **High Availability**: Enable horizontal scaling and failover capabilities

### Success Criteria
- Zero data loss during migration
- Improved concurrent user handling (target: 10,000+ concurrent connections)
- Reduced latency (target: <100ms response time for API calls)
- Enhanced security posture (OWASP compliance)
- Simplified deployment and maintenance

## Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture
```
Client → Node.js/Express → SQLite
         (serves everything)
```

### Target Architecture
```
Client → nginx → Node.js/Express → PostgreSQL
         (static)  (API only)        (clustered)
```

## Technology Stack

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL 15+**: Primary database
- **pgBouncer**: Connection pooling
- **pg-migrate**: Database migrations
- **node-postgres (pg)**: Node.js PostgreSQL client

### Web Server Layer
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file server
- **Certbot**: SSL/TLS certificate management
- **ModSecurity**: Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Application Layer
- **Node.js**: Application runtime (existing)
- **PM2**: Process management and clustering
- **Redis**: Session storage and caching

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Metrics visualization
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging
- **Sentry**: Error tracking

2. Database query optimization
3. CDN integration
4. Compression and minification
5. Resource optimization

### Phase 5: High Availability (Week 6)
1. Database replication setup
2. Application clustering
3. Health checks and monitoring
4. Automated failover
5. Disaster recovery planning

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss or corruption
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup strategy, staged migration
2. **Downtime**: Service interruption during migration
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment, maintenance window
3. **Performance Regression**: Slower performance post-migration
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, rollback plan

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Configuration Complexity**: Misconfiguration of new components
   - Mitigation: Infrastructure as Code, automated testing
2. **Learning Curve**: Team unfamiliarity with PostgreSQL/nginx
   - Mitigation: Documentation, training, gradual rollout

## Resource Requirements

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL server (minimum 4 CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD)
- nginx server (minimum 2 CPU, 4GB RAM)
- Redis server (minimum 2 CPU, 4GB RAM)
- Load balancer (if using cloud provider)

### Personnel
- Database Administrator (part-time)
- DevOps Engineer (full-time during implementation)
- Backend Developer (full-time)
- QA Engineer (part-time)

### Budget Estimate
- Infrastructure: $500-1000/month (cloud hosting)
- SSL Certificate: $0 (Let's Encrypt) or $200/year (EV certificate)
- Monitoring Tools: $200-500/month
- Total Initial Setup: ~$5,000-10,000

## Success Metrics

### Performance KPIs
- API response time < 100ms (p95)
- Static asset loading < 50ms
- Database query time < 10ms (p95)
- Concurrent users > 10,000
- Uptime > 99.9%

### Security KPIs
- Zero security breaches
- WAF block rate < 1% false positives
- SSL/TLS score A+ (SSL Labs)
- OWASP Top 10 compliance

### Operational KPIs
- Deployment time < 5 minutes
- Recovery time objective (RTO) < 1 hour
- Recovery point objective (RPO) < 15 minutes
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) < 30 minutes
